üé® Portfolio Website Development - Conversation History
=====================================================

üìÅ Project Setup:
- Created portfolio folder in Start_1 directory
- User requested to create a text file called "steps" to track conversation history and prompts

# üí¨ Prompt 1:
You are my pair‚Äëprogrammer inside Cursor. Create a modern, responsive portfolio site with this exact structure:

üìÇ Create these files in the project root:
- index.html
- styles.css
- main.js
- content/content.json
- assets/music/  (empty placeholder; I'll drop MP3s later)
- assets/images/art/ (empty)
- assets/images/photography/ (empty)
- assets/images/games/ (empty)
- assets/images/apps/ (empty)
- assets/images/og/ (empty; add a placeholder OG image via data URI or minimal SVG for now)
- README.md  (brief how-to)

üé® **Design + UX requirements**
- Aesthetic: dark, elegant "glass" cards, soft gradients, subtle motion. Accent color variable `--accent`. Respect `prefers-color-scheme` and provide a **Dark/Light toggle** in the header that persists to localStorage.
- Header: site title (use "YOUR NAME"), sticky top nav with links to sections: Home, Musician, Writer, Game Design Analysis, Art, Video Games, Street Photography, Vibe Coding Apps, Contact.
- Hero/Home: big intro with your name, a short tagline, and CTA buttons that scroll to sections.
- Each section uses a consistent card grid and section header. Smooth scroll with reduced‚Äëmotion guard.
- Accessibility: semantic HTML, alt text from content, keyboard‚Äënavigable (focus rings), ARIA labels where useful.
- Performance: lazy‚Äëload images (`loading="lazy"`), responsive images (`sizes`/`srcset` where relevant), CSS only for icons/chevrons if possible. No frameworks, no external libs/fonts.
- SEO: basic `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, canonical link, Open Graph + Twitter tags (use placeholder image from assets/images/og/). Add simple JSON‚ÄëLD Person schema with name and headline.

üìÑ **Content system**
- Put *all real content* in `content/content.json`. `main.js` should fetch that JSON and render the sections.
- JSON shape (example placeholders; I'll replace later):
  {
    "site": { "name": "YOUR NAME", "tagline": "Musician ‚Ä¢ Writer ‚Ä¢ Game Design ‚Ä¢ Art ‚Ä¢ Photography ‚Ä¢ Vibe Coding" },
    "musician": { "bio": "Short music bio.", "tracks": [{ "title": "Track One", "file": "assets/music/track-one.mp3", "year": 2024, "links": [{ "label": "Bandcamp", "url": "#" }] }] },
    "writer": { "intro": "Novels & excerpts.", "posts": [{ "title": "Novel Excerpt", "date": "2024-07-01", "tags": ["novel"], "html": "<p>Excerpt HTML here‚Ä¶</p>" }] },
    "analysis": { "intro": "Game design essays.", "essays": [{ "title": "Juice & Feedback in Platformers", "date": "2024-05-01", "tags": ["design","analysis"], "html": "<p>Essay HTML‚Ä¶</p>" }] },
    "art": { "intro": "Watercolor & AI art.", "works": [{ "title": "Blue Wash", "type": "watercolor", "src": "assets/images/art/blue-wash.jpg", "year": 2023, "tags": ["watercolor"] }, { "title": "Neon City", "type": "ai", "src": "assets/images/art/neon-city.jpg", "year": 2024, "tags": ["ai"] }] },
    "games": { "intro": "Playable things.", "projects": [{ "title": "Sky Runner", "thumb": "assets/images/games/skyrunner.jpg", "year": 2023, "tags": ["unity","pc"], "links": [{ "label": "Itch.io", "url": "#" }, { "label": "Trailer", "url": "#" }], "summary": "Arcade runner with procedural levels." }] },
    "photography": { "intro": "Street moments.", "photos": [{ "title": "Alley Light", "src": "assets/images/photography/alley-light.jpg", "year": 2022, "tags": ["street","bw"] }] },
    "apps": { "intro": "Vibe coding apps.", "projects": [{ "title": "FocusTimer", "thumb": "assets/images/apps/focustimer.jpg", "year": 2024, "tags": ["web","productivity"], "links": [{ "label": "GitHub", "url": "#" }, { "label": "Live", "url": "#" }], "summary": "Pomodoro timer with tasks." }] },
    "contact": { "email": "you@example.com", "links": [{ "label": "GitHub", "url": "#" }, { "label": "Instagram", "url": "#" }, { "label": "YouTube", "url": "#" }] }
  }

‚ö° **Features to implement now**
- Render all sections from the JSON.
- Global search box in header that filters visible cards by title/tags across sections.
- Tag chips on cards; clicking a chip filters that section. Show a "Clear filters" chip when active.
- Lightbox modal for images (Art & Photography): click thumbnail ‚Üí open modal with large image, caption, Left/Right arrow keys, ESC to close, mobile-friendly swipe (basic touch).
- For Musician: render a simple playlist (list of tracks with Play/Pause buttons). For now, use native <audio> with a custom UI wrapper; next phase we'll enhance controls.
- Card "Details" modal for Games and Apps: clicking a card opens a modal with bigger image, full summary, and action buttons (links).
- Contact section: mailto button (pre-fill subject) and social links.

üéõÔ∏è **Header controls**
- Dark/Light toggle that persists (`localStorage.theme = "dark"|"light"`). Default to system preference on first load.
- Search input that filters as you type (debounced), with clear button (√ó).

üíª **Code quality**
- Keep `index.html` minimal; render dynamic parts via `main.js`.
- `styles.css` with CSS variables, grid utilities, card styles, and light/dark schemes.
- `main.js`: small renderer helpers (renderSection, renderCards, renderLightbox, applyFilters), intersection‚Äëobserver reveal animations, and reduced‚Äëmotion fallbacks.
- Add TODO comments where I need to drop in real media later.

‚úÖ **Acceptance (must pass immediately)**
1) I can scroll to each section from the nav; the header sticks.
2) The site shows placeholder content from `content.json`.
3) Search filters cards across multiple sections.
4) Clicking an image opens a lightbox; ESC closes; arrows navigate.
5) Clicking a Game/App card opens a details modal with links.
6) Theme toggle works and persists across refresh.
7) Images are lazy-loaded; keyboard focus outlines are visible.

Create/modify all files and show a single combined patch. Do not print explanations, just the patch.

# üí¨ Prompt 2:
Enhance the Musician section audio player:

- Replace the simple list with a custom playlist UI: current track title, Play/Pause, Previous, Next, Seek bar, Elapsed/Duration, Volume, and "Open Link" dropdown using the track's external links.
- Keyboard: Space toggles play, Left/Right arrows seek ¬±5s when player is focused.
- Visually highlight the current track in the list; double-click a track to play it. Auto-advance to next track at end; loop to first after last.
- Persist last played track index + position in localStorage (key: "portfolio.audioState") and restore on load if the file exists.
- Keep it accessible (aria-labels, role attributes). No external libraries.

Update main.js, styles.css, and any necessary HTML hooks. Return a single combined patch.

# üí¨ Prompt 3:
Improve galleries (Art + Street Photography):

- Add filter chips above each gallery (e.g., "All", "Watercolor", "AI", "Street", "B/W", years) auto-derived from tags in content.json. Persist last filter per section.
- In the lightbox, add: zoom (fit/1:1 toggle), filename/title, year, and a "Download" button (uses the image src).
- Add keyboard shortcuts inside the lightbox: +/- to zoom, ArrowLeft/ArrowRight navigate, Esc closes. Trap focus while open.
- Ensure images use `srcset/sizes` for responsive loading; keep simple widths (e.g., 480/960/1440). If high-res variants do not exist yet, gracefully fallback to the same src.

Patch main.js + styles.css and adjust index.html hooks if needed. One combined patch only.

# üí¨ Prompt 4:
Upgrade Writer and Game Design Analysis sections:

- Render lists of posts/essays with date, tags, and excerpt (first 200 chars). Add a "Read" button that opens a modal reading view with larger typography and previous/next navigation within that section.
- Support minimal rich text in content.json `html` (headings, paragraphs, links, lists, blockquote, code). Sanitize/escape unknown elements.
- Add per-section search input that filters posts by title/tags.
- Persist the last scroll position in the modal between prev/next.

Update main.js + styles.css; small hooks in index.html if required. Single patch.

# üí¨ Prompt 5:
Enhance Video Games and Vibe Coding Apps:

- Card grid with hover effect. Each card shows title, year, tags, and CTA links (e.g., GitHub, Live, Trailer, Itch).
- Add multi-select tag filters (chips) at the top of each section (engine, platform, year). Persist selected filters per section.
- Card "Details" modal: bigger image, summary, and the same CTAs, with keyboard navigation (Left/Right) to move between filtered items.

Update main.js + styles.css; one combined patch.

# üí¨ Prompt 6:
Polish Contact and footer:

- Contact area: show email with a copy-to-clipboard button and a "Compose Email" mailto link with prefilled subject "Hello from your portfolio".
- Social links: GitHub, Instagram, YouTube from content.json; open in new tab with rel="noopener".
- Footer: ¬© YEAR YOUR NAME ¬∑ small nav shortcuts (Back to top, Email).
- Add small toast notifications for "Copied!" actions.

Patch index.html, styles.css, main.js. Return one combined patch.

# üí¨ Prompt 7:
Maintenance sync and confirmations

- Verified that all features requested in Prompts 1‚Äì6 are implemented in the current codebase (dynamic sections, global/per‚Äësection search, gallery filters + lightbox with zoom and keyboard, Musician custom player with persistence, Writer/Analysis reader modal with sanitization and prev/next, Games/Apps details modal and multi‚Äëselect filters, Contact + footer polish with toasts, theme persistence).
- Confirmed Open Graph placeholder exists at `assets/images/og/og.svg` and is referenced by meta tags and runtime updates.
- Next content step: replace `YOUR NAME` and placeholders in `portfolio/content/content.json` with real data when available; this will drive the header, meta, JSON‚ÄëLD, and section content automatically.
- Separate app (FocusTimer) README updated to log Prompt 7 status and commit to ongoing README updates.

# üí¨ Prompt 8:
Update styles.css and main.js with three improvements:

(1) Background gradient:
- Replace any light body background with a fixed dark gradient:
  html,body{min-height:100%}
  body{background:#0b0e13;}
  body::before{content:"";position:fixed;inset:0;z-index:-1;background:
    radial-gradient(1000px 500px at 50% -150px, rgba(255,255,255,.06), transparent 70%),
    linear-gradient(180deg,#0b0e13 0%, #151a1f 45%, #2a3039 100%);}
- Keep cards readable on dark background (glass effect): 
  .card{background:rgba(255,255,255,.06);border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.12);backdrop-filter:blur(6px)}

(2) Nav abbreviations on narrow widths:
- In main.js, when building the nav, render both long and short labels:
  <a ... title="Game Design Analysis"><span class="nav-long">Game Design Analysis</span><span class="nav-short" aria-hidden="true">GDA</span></a>
  Do the same for "Vibe Coding Apps" ‚Üí short "VCA". Leave other items with the same long/short if desired.
- In styles.css add:
  .nav-short{display:none}
  @media (max-width:1200px){ .nav-long{display:none} .nav-short{display:inline} }
- Ensure current/active styles and focus rings still apply.

(3) Music player containment (Safari):
- Structure (main.js) inside each track card:
  <div class="player">
    <div class="transport">‚Ä¶</div>
    <input class="seek" type="range" ... />
    <div class="vol"><input class="volume" type="range" min="0" max="1" step="0.01"/></div>
  </div>
- CSS (styles.css):
  .track-card{position:relative;overflow:hidden;display:grid;gap:8px}
  .player{display:grid;grid-template-columns:auto 1fr auto;gap:10px;align-items:center;min-width:0}
  .player .seek{min-width:0;width:100%}
  .player .vol{width:72px;max-width:72px;overflow:hidden}
  .player input[type="range"]{-webkit-appearance:none;width:100%;height:28px;background:transparent}
  .player input[type="range"]::-webkit-slider-runnable-track{height:4px;border-radius:4px;background:rgba(255,255,255,.25)}
  .player input[type="range"]::-webkit-slider-thumb{-webkit-appearance:none;width:14px;height:14px;border-radius:50%;background:#fff;margin-top:-5px}
  .player input[type="range"]::-moz-range-track{height:4px;border-radius:4px;background:rgba(255,255,255,.25)}
  .player input[type="range"]::-moz-range-thumb{width:14px;height:14px;border-radius:50%;background:#fff}
Return one combined patch; keep behavior identical.

# üí¨ Prompt 9:
Add Google Drive support:

content.json may use:
Art/Photography items: { "title": "...", "driveId": "FILE_ID", "year": 2024, "tags":[...] } // or "src" as before
Musician tracks: allow "driveId" instead of "file". For driveId, show an "Open in Drive" button that opens a modal with <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/ID/preview">; keep custom <audio> only for non-Drive URLs.
Games/Apps projects: allow { "embed": { "type": "gdrive", "id": "FILE_ID" } } to open a modal with the same preview iframe.

main.js:
Add helpers:
function parseDriveId(str) { /* handle /file/d/ID/view, open?id=ID, uc?id=ID, plain ID */ }
const driveImageUrl = id => https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=${id};
const drivePreviewUrl = id => https://drive.google.com/file/d/${id}/preview;
When rendering:

Art/Photography: if driveId, use <img loading="lazy" src=driveImageUrl(id) alt=...>.
Musician: if driveId, render title/year/tags + a small "Open in Drive" button that opens a modal with iframe(drivePreviewUrl).
Games/Apps: if embed.type==="gdrive", open modal with iframe(drivePreviewUrl).
Ensure the modal traps focus, closes on ESC, returns focus to the opener.

# üí¨ Prompt 10:
Ensure all paths are relative, not absolute:
	‚Ä¢	In index.html:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
<script src="main.js" defer></script>
‚Ä¢	In main.js when you fetch:
fetch('content/content.json')
Hide/lock the admin page in production
Make sure your admin.html/admin.js checks:
if (location.hostname !== 'localhost' && location.hostname !== '127.0.0.1') {
  // show "Admin is local only" banner and disable actions
}

# üí¨ Prompt 11:
Ensure the nav renders long+short labels and shows short at ‚â§1200px:
- "Game Design Analysis" ‚Üí "GDA"
- "Vibe Coding Apps" ‚Üí "VCA"
Keep tooltips with full names. Minimal patch in main.js and styles.css.

# üí¨ Prompt 12:

do 2 now, then we will do 1

# üí¨ Prompt 17:
Create tools/check-links.js that:
- Loads content.json
- Verifies local assets exist (assets/... paths)
- For driveId items, constructs the preview URL and HEAD-requests it (skip if offline or blocked)
- Prints a summary with counts and filenames; exits 1 if any local asset missing

Add npm scripts:
  "check:links": "node tools/check-links.js",
  "check": "npm run validate && npm run check:links"

Patch only.

remeber to add these promps to the steps file every time i give them to you

# üí¨ Prompt 18:
Create tools/drive-import.js that accepts CLI args:
  node tools/drive-import.js --type=art --title="My Painting" --year=2025 --tags=watercolor,blue --drive="PASTE_DRIVE_URL_OR_ID"
Supported types: art, photo, track, game, app.
- Parse the Drive ID from common link formats.
- Build the correct object for that section:
  art/photo: { title, driveId, year, tags[] }
  track: { title, year, driveId, links:[{label:"Drive", url:viewLink}] }
  game/app: { title, year, tags[], embed:{type:"gdrive", id}, summary:"(fill me)" }
- Append to content.json (newest first) and pretty-print.
- Run validation at the end; if invalid, revert the write and show errors.

Add npm script: "add:drive": "node tools/drive-import.js"
Patch only.

# üí¨ Prompt 19:
npm i ajv node-fetch@3 globby mime slugify
# (node 18+ has fetch; node-fetch is optional‚ÄîCodex may choose one)
npm run validate
npm run check
# Try a test drive import:
node tools/drive-import.js --type=art --title="Test Drive Art" --year=2025 --tags=watercolor --drive="PASTE_LINK_OR_ID"
git add -A && git commit -m "tools: validators and importers" && git push

# üí¨ Prompt 19:
Create tools/ingest-local.js that:
- Takes --src=path and --type=art|photo|track|game|app
- For images/audio dropped into a temp folder, slugify filenames, move them into assets/images/... or assets/music/, avoiding collisions
- Emit proposed JSON entries to stdout and optionally apply them when --apply is passed
- Update content.json and validate

Add npm script: "add:local": "node tools/ingest-local.js"
Patch only.

# üí¨ Prompt 20:
Add .github/workflows/ci.yml that runs on push and PR:
- Setup Node 20
- npm ci (or npm i)
- npm run check (validates schema + links)
- If branch is main, also upload artifacts (logs) so I can download failures

Minimal, fast workflow. Patch only.

# üí¨ Prompt 21:
Add tools/make-srcset.js that:
- Scans assets/images/{art,photography}/**/*.{jpg,jpeg,png}
- For each, generates 480/960/1440 px widths into a parallel folder structure under assets/images/_generated/
- Writes a manifest mapping original -> srcset array [{w:480, src:"..."}...]
- Optionally, update content.json entries to include a srcset field when the generated images exist

Add npm script: "images:build": "node tools/make-srcset.js"

In main.js, if an item has srcset, render <img srcset="..." sizes="(min-width: 900px) 33vw, 90vw"> and fallback to src.

Patch only and note Sharp dependency in README.
